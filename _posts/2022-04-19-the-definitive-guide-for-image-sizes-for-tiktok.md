## **What happens if your TikTok is too small.**

Firstly, you can use image editing software, which will allow you to enlarge it, but the quality can be degraded. You can also create a new image, by targeting the perfect PFP TikTok dimensions of 200 x 200 pixels.

## **How to turn your TikTok into a GIF.**

While you are working on different PPP for TikTok, you might decide that a static image is a bit annoying. Instead, you may want to put your PFP on the move to attract attention and set yourself apart from the crowd. To do this, simply upload a video like PFP, instead of an image.

## **Conclusion**
