A MEME is a funny way of representing a funny situation or a person in a funny way, according to the meaning is “**meme**, is an idea, behavior, or style (meme) that is spread via the Internet, often through social media platforms and especially for humorous purposes. What is considered a meme may vary across different communities on the Internet and is subject to change over time. Traditionally, memes consisted of a combination of image macros and a concept or catchphrase, but the concept has since become broader and more multi-faceted, evolving to include more elaborate structures such as challenges, GIFs, videos, and viral sensations.”

**TREND-**

Modern memes can generally be described as more visually (rather than contextually) humorous, absurd, niche, diverse, and self-referential than earlier forms. As a result, they are less intuitive and are less likely to be fully understood by a wider audience. By the mid-2010s, they began to arise first in the form of "dank" memes, a sub-genre of memes usually involving meme formats in a different way to the image macros that were in large use before. The term "dank", which means "a cold, damp place", was later adapted by marijuana smokers to refer to high-quality marijuana, and then became an ironic term for a type of meme, also becoming synonymous for "cool". This term originally meant a meme that was significantly different from the norm but is now used mainly to differentiate these modern types of memes from other, older types such as image macros. Dank memes can also refer to those which are "exceptionally unique or odd". They have been described as "internet in-jokes" that are "so played out that they become funny again" or are "so nonsensical that they are hilarious".

ARE MEMES LEGAL??-

Under Section 2(c) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, a meme could be classified as an 'artistic work' which states that an artistic work includes painting, sculpture, drawing (including a diagram, map, chart, or plan), an engraving or a photograph, whether or not any such work possesses artistic quality. The section uses the phrase _"whether or not possessing artistic quality"_, the memes that are rage comics or those such as Keyboard cat would enjoy protection as they are original creations in the form of a painting, drawing, photograph, or short video clip, despite not having artistic quality. Memes that are made from cinematograph still or photographs, the original image in the background for the meme would also be protected as the picture or the still from the series/movie is an 'artistic work'. These memes are a modification of that already existing artistic work with some little amount of creativity and therefore, they would also enjoy copyright protection. India follows a fair dealing approach as an exception to copyright infringement under Section 52(1)(a) for the purposes of private or personal use, criticism, or review. The analysis requires three steps: the amount and substantiality of dealing, the purpose of copying, and the effect on potential markets.
