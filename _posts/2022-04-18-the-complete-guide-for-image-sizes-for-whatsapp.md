However, WhatsApp is undoubtedly one of the biggest messaging services in the world right now and the company isn’t done yet. They are continuously adding new features to the application to make it more effective.

## **-Whatsapp size guide**

However, we did an experiment and uploaded a _rectangle-shaped_ picture of mine. Naturally, WhatsApp asked me to crop it and showed the ‘cropper’. I extended the lines to the maximum capacity and checked the newly cropped image.

When I managed to check out the dimension of the cropped profile picture that was being shown, I found it to be 290 Pixels in height and 290 Pixels in Width.

Next time, I took a picture of the exact dimension- 290*290 Pixels and uploaded it to make it the DP. Bingo, the cropper just contained the entire image!

But remember that to use an entire image as the DP, it doesn’t have to be 290*290 _Pixels in size!_ However, you can use a complete image as your profile picture without cropping, by making it square-shaped. I can do this by making the height and width measures of an image to be the same.

## **Whatsapp profile image size**

Use the Whatsapp profile photo image resizer tools, and WhatsApp DP image resize online tool to generate exact standard file sizes in pixels required to share on this platform.

From the tool available, select the WhatsApp menu and choose the option you require resizing the image to exact dimensions.
