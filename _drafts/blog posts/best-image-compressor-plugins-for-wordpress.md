# **A list of the five best image compressor plugins for WordPress**

Congratulations! Your search for “Best image compressor plugins for WordPress” has landed you in the perfect place. Here, we will be looking in detail at some of those plugins that can help with image optimization and compression and will be also covering some of the free plugins. But before jumping straight into the how-to, we will first be going over some technical definitions so as to better understand the process. So let’s get started without further ado.

**What is a WordPress plugin?**

_WordPress plugins are essentially bits of code that “plugs in” to your self-hosted WordPress site. Hence, comes to the name “plugins”.In layman terms, a WordPress plugin is something that adds new functionality to your WordPress site or extends existing functionality on your site._

**What is image compression?**

Image compression is a process of reducing the size of the image by lowering its quality. Although the quality is only lowered to such a level that the image can still be clearly seen and accepted. This reduction in file size allows more images to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space. It also reduces the time required for images to be sent over the Internet or downloaded from Web pages.

We use image compressors to compress an image. Each image compressor may work differently as there are various techniques of compressing an image where each technique differs from the other in terms of the amount of compression and the output quality.

**Benefits of using an image compressor plugin**

Following are the advantages of using an image compressor plugin for your WordPress site:

* Compressing an image reduces its size and hence it consumes less bandwidth and storage space.
* Compressed images reduce the overall page size.
* Using image compressor plugins facilitates faster loading times thereby making your WordPress site fast and smooth.
* They can also help in boosting the SEO of your site because of the fast loading pages.
* Lastly, compressed images save mobile data plans for you and your visitors alike.
