      "question": "How many image parts do I get if I enter 20 in the space of rows and 50 in the space of columns while splitting an image using the image splitter from safeimagekit.com?",
      "answer": "The image splitter feature from safeimagekit.com is fitted with basic math codes which have the ability to perform simple calculations. So, when we enter 20 in the space of rows and 50 in the space of columns the page performs basic math and the number of rows is multiplied by the number of columns such that we get their product as divisions of the image. So, 50*20=1000 image divisions(parts) of the uploaded image. These image parts can be downloaded in the form of png file separately by part or can be downloaded as a zip file."
