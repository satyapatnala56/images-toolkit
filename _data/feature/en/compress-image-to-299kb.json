    {
      "question": "What is image compression? Why do we need image compression?",
      "answer": "Image compression aims to eliminate image data redundancy and irrelevance in order to store or transmit data more efficiently. Its goal is to reduce the number of bits necessary to represent an image. There are two types of image compression: lossy and lossless. The key benefits of compression are storage hardware savings, data transmission time savings, and communication bandwidth savings. This can save you a lot of money. Compressed files require far less storage capacity than uncompressed data, resulting in significant savings in storage costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does an image compressor do?",
      "answer": "The technical process of compressing an image file size without sacrificing its quality is known as image compression. This results in the digital image retaining its appearance and physical qualities, but at a significantly lower size, which takes up less space and is appropriate for posting to relevant websites. The smaller file size helps you to save the image more economically and efficiently, as the amount of memory space it takes up will be greatly reduced, and the amount of time and bandwidth necessary to upload and download the image will be significantly reduced."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the types of image compressions?",
      "answer": "There are lossless and lossy image compression algorithms available. It is feasible to reduce the size of a compressed file without affecting image quality. Lossless compression, in general, but not always, results in larger files than lossy compression. It's advisable to use lossless compression when working with images to reduce the number of recompression stages. Lossy coding compression algorithms preserve a representation of the original uncompressed image that may appear flawless but aren't quite a replica. Lossy compression, when compared to lossless compression, typically results in smaller file sizes. In lossy compression methods, variable compression, which compromises image quality for file size, is prevalent."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does compress image to 299kb tool dimensions tool work?",
      "answer": "Click Choose File to upload an image from your device, or use the drop-down menu to submit an image from Dropbox or Google Drive. You may now select the files you want to upload. These factors include the name of the image, its size, its type, and so on once we upload it. The last updated parameter provides us with the time, date, and time zone where it was last modified. This also displays a progress indicator after uploading and before we begin altering the picture file that was uploaded. It allows the user to change the image's proportions by modifying the metrics such as width and height. The max-height and max-width settings give the user a maximum limit for photo compression. While the min-width and min-height parameters provide the user with a lower limit for photo compression. The convert size option allows the user to compress the entire image. After uploading the image, go to the Enter the quality section to access the quality modification feature. This affects the overall sharpness, contrast, blur (in small amounts), and many other image properties. The Mimetype option allows the user to select the format of the image after it has been compressed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it possible to uncompress an image?",
      "answer": "No quality is gained by converting it to a lossless format after it has been compressed. Lossy compression, by definition, discards information that can never be recovered. This indicates that an image cannot be uncompressed once it has been compressed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is image compression ratio?",
      "answer": "The ratio of uncompressed to compressed size is known as the data compression ratio. For example, a representation that decreases a file's storage space from 100 KB to 50 KB has a compression ratio of 100/50 = 2, often notated as an explicit ratio, 2:1, or as an implicit ratio, 2/1."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does compression alter the size of an image?",
      "answer": "Yes, by compressing images in your document, you can minimize the file size and conserve disc space. Based on how you intend to use the image, such as viewing on screen or in an email message, the compression choices minimize both the file size and image dimensions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to log in or download any software to use this compress mage to 299kb tool?",
      "answer": "No, our compress image to 299kb tool is entirely online and does not require you to share any of your personal information with us, such as your email address or password.

    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between compressor and limiter?",
      "answer": "Only the compression ratio is different between a compressor and a limiter. A limiter is a device that limits the maximum level to a set value, usually to avoid overloading. A compressor, as opposed to a limiter, is used for less drastic, more creative dynamic control, and it frequently uses lower compression ratios."

    {
      "question": "Is compress image to 299kb tool safe to use?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What does compress option mean for images?",
      "answer": "Image compression is the technique of reducing the size of a graphics file in bytes while maintaining image quality at an acceptable level. Because of the reduction in file size, more images can be stored in a given amount of disc or memory space than previously possible."
